# Repository Python for PhD at UniPG

The files have been used in the course "Python for Numerical Computing and Development of Scientific Application" 
for the *International and Industrial PhD Program of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering* at University of Perugia
in the second period of academic year 2023/24.

## COURSE DESCRIPTION
The course aims to provide skills for the use of the Python programming language in the scientific field. In the first part, the students will learn the basics of the language (data types and structures, syntax, control flow tools, input and output, classes); in the second part, the students will learn how to use tools dedicated to the management and processing of scientific data. Particular attention will be paid to possible applications in civil and environmental engineering research and to the acquisition of the skills necessary to share the results of research by means of stand-alone applications or web apps.
At the end of the course the students are required to develop an app aimed at solving a scientific problem (it is possible to work in a team).

The overall length of the course is 30 hours (5CFU).
